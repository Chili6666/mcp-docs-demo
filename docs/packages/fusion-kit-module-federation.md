# Fusion Kit Module Federation

A utility library for managing and consuming remote modules in a micro-frontend architecture. This package provides tools to construct, split, and manage remote module paths, as well as monitor the health of remote modules, without directly referencing or depending on Module Federation APIs. Instead, it focuses on consuming exposes generated by Module Federation, ensuring flexibility and decoupling from specific federation implementations.

## Overview

This library is designed to help applications manage remote modules in a modular and scalable way. By abstracting the details of remote module paths and health checks, it enables seamless integration of micro-frontends or remote components, regardless of the underlying federation technology.

### Why Avoid Direct Module Federation References?

- **Decoupling:** By not directly referencing Module Federation APIs, the library remains agnostic to the underlying federation implementation. This allows for easier upgrades, replacements, or coexistence with other module loading strategies.
- **Flexibility:** Consumers can use any system that generates exposes compatible with Module Federation, without being locked into a specific API or version.
- **Simplicity:** The API surface is focused on what matters—consuming remote exposes—without exposing unnecessary complexity or implementation details.
- **Testability:** Decoupling from federation internals makes the codebase easier to test and maintain.
- **Future-proofing**: Allows for upgrades, replacements, or coexistence with other module loading strategies

## Installation

```bash
npm install @inform-appshell/fusion-kit-module-federation
```

## Key Features

- **Remote Module Path Management**: Construct and split remote module paths
- **Federation Module Manager**: Register, load, and manage remote modules
- **Health Monitoring**: Monitor the health and availability of remote modules
- **Utility Functions**: Helper functions for working with remote module paths
- **Framework Agnostic**: Works with any Module Federation setup (Webpack, Vite, etc.)

## Core Components

### FederationModuleManager

Handles the registration, loading, and management of remote modules. It abstracts the logic required to interact with remote exposes, providing a clean API for consumers.

### RemoteModuleHealthService

Provides utilities to check the health and availability of remote modules. This helps ensure that remote modules are accessible and functioning before attempting to load or use them.

## Utils

A set of utility functions for working with remote module paths:
- `getRemoteModulePath(remoteName, moduleName)`: Constructs a remote module path string.
- `splitRemoteModulePath(remoteModulePath)`: Splits a remote module path into its remote name and module name parts.

## Examples

```typescript


```
